This repository includes:
- Step-by-step instructions for building your own AD lab in VirtualBox
- PowerShell scripts and configuration files

- Troubleshooting notes, challenges encountered, and key takeaways

Whether you're a student, early-career professional, or lab builder, this documentation is designed to guide you through creating your own AD home lab and understanding how enterprise directory services operate in practice.
